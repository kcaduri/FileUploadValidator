V1 - In this updated example, we added the hasMaliciousContent method that utilizes the ClamAV antivirus scanner to scan the PDF file for potential malware. You need to have the ClamAV daemon running on the local machine for this to work.

The hasMaliciousContent method reads the PDF file as a byte array and passes it to the ClamAVClient for scanning. The ScanResult object contains information about the scan, including whether the file is infected with malware. If the result indicates that the file is infected, the method returns true.

In the main method, we added a check for malicious content after checking for password protection. If the PDF file is found to contain malicious content, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it proceeds with processing the uploaded PDF.

Please note that this example assumes you have properly set up and configured the ClamAV antivirus scanner and have the necessary dependencies in your project. Adjust the ClamAVClient initialization with the appropriate connection details to your ClamAV server.

V2 - In this updated version, we added methods to check for password protection in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files using Apache POI. We also extended the getFileType method to identify Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text files based on their file extensions.

The processUploadedFile method has been updated to handle different file types accordingly. You can add your specific processing logic within the respective processPDF, processWord, processExcel, processPowerPoint, and processText methods.

Remember to have the necessary dependencies in your project for Apache POI and ClamAV, and ensure that the ClamAV daemon is running on the local machine.

Please note that while using an antivirus scanner like ClamAV can help detect known malware, it is not foolproof, and additional security measures should be implemented to ensure the safety of uploaded files.

V3 - Here's an updated version of the code that checks for password protection and potential malicious content in PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text files using Apache PDFBox, Apache POI, and the ClamAV antivirus scanner:

In this updated version, we added methods to check for password protection in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files using Apache POI. We also extended the getFileType method to identify Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and text files based on their file extensions.

The processUploadedFile method has been updated to handle different file types accordingly. You can add your specific processing logic within the respective processPDF, processWord, processExcel, processPowerPoint, and processText methods.

Remember to have the necessary dependencies in your project for Apache POI and ClamAV, and ensure that the ClamAV daemon is running on the local machine.

Please note that while using an antivirus scanner like ClamAV can help detect known malware, it is not foolproof, and additional security measures should be implemented to ensure the safety of uploaded files.

V4 - Here's an updated version of the code that quarantines files if they are detected as potentially password-protected or malicious:
In this updated version, if a file is detected as potentially password-protected or containing malicious content, the quarantineFile method is called to move the file to a quarantine directory. You can modify the quarantine directory path as per your requirements.

Please note that you need to create the quarantine directory before running the code.

By quarantining the files, you ensure that potentially harmful or suspicious files are isolated from the rest of the system, preventing them from causing any harm.

Remember to have the necessary dependencies in your project for Apache POI and ClamAV, and ensure that the ClamAV daemon is running on the local machine.

Replace "path/to/uploaded/file.xlsx" with the actual filepath of the uploaded file. Ensure that you handle filepaths securely and avoid disclosing sensitive information in your code or in the output messages.

Additionally, make sure to create the quarantine directory before running the code and adjust the quarantine directory path as per your requirements.

Remember to have the necessary dependencies in your project for Apache POI and ClamAV, and ensure that the ClamAV daemon is running on the local machine.

V5 - To make the code more secure, we should handle exceptions more gracefully without printing sensitive information. Here's an updated version of the code that handles exceptions securely:

Again, remember to replace "path/to/uploaded/file.xlsx" with the actual filepath of the uploaded file. Ensure that you handle filepaths securely and avoid disclosing sensitive information in your code or in the output messages.

Additionally, make sure to create the quarantine directory before running the code and adjust the quarantine directory path as per your requirements.

Remember to have the necessary dependencies in your project for Apache POI and ClamAV, and ensure that the ClamAV daemon is running on the local machine.

V6 - In this updated code, the filename validation is performed using a regular expression pattern. If the filename is invalid, the file is rejected and moved to the quarantine folder. The filepath is not disclosed in any of the output messages. Exceptions are handled securely by printing a generic error message and stack trace is not printed.
